                    Many other general IT firms will charge a lot of money to give you a simple wordpress site or a site that GoDaddy built for them.<br /><br />
                    Everything you see here was done by myself, by hand, in a code editor window. It is wrtten using the latest technologies in use on the web.<br />
                    If you need a custom site like this. With complex, hand coded interactions between elements. It can be done. I can also suggest a hosting provider and setup a professional email account with your own business's name on it<br /><br />
                    Should you need a site that's simpler, or simply inexpensive. I can use my knowledge to sculpt predefined templates available from many popular web hosting companies to fit your needs.<br />
